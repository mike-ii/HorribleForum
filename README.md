# HorribleForum
A horrifying complex and stupid forum client and server

# Goal
Create a forum that functions fine on the client side while
having a back end server using as many languages as possible,
but each language will be used as they are NOT intended to be used.

The client should not be able to tell that the server is horrific.
The only allowed client side compromise is speed.

## Rules

1. Absolutely no `.html` files. HTML can be embedded in another language, but `.html` files are not allowed.

2. Files must be used as databases, while *actual* databases can only be used for language-language communication. (Non database files cannot be used to communicate)

3. You can only use the *strength* of a language if it is the only option, but it must be embedded in another language if at all possible (talking to you css).

4. Each language should stick to one thing, and nothing else (if possible), and the server should be as modular as possible. You can use a language to coordinate all other ones, but only if the language is *not* intended to do that.

5. Make everything as stupid and horrifying as possible, but still functional.
